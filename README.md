Project in Data Scientist Nanodegree of Udacity

Project Motivation
We want to answer the following business questions:
1. As a programmer, should I go to work in the western world (e.g. America, Europe, etc.) or remain in the eastern world (e.g. India, China, etc.)?
2. What is the salary difference in the western world and in the eastern world?
3. How are the programmers satisfying about their job between these two sides of the world?
4. Are there more jobs opportunity in the western world than that in the eastern world?
